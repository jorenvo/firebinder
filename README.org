* Firebinder
Firebinder is an extensible Firefox extension that provides GNU
Emacs-like features for Firefox.
** Features
*** Emacs-like keybindings
Firebinder provides a simple way to define keybindings that start with
a modified key (control/alt).
*** Minibuffer
A minibuffer system whose behavior very closely resembles that of GNU
Emacs.
- Pressing <tab> completes to longest common prefix

- Pressing <tab> brings up a list of possible completions when applicable

*** Built in key chord system
David Andersson wrote an excellent extension for GNU Emacs called
key-chord. Firebinder implements this idea for Firefox. This allows
users to bind any JavaScript function to simultaneously pressed
keys. The demonstration below shows the browser going back by pressing
<comma>, <period> and <quote> simultaneously. Contrary to key-chord in
GNU Emacs, the Firebinder key-chord implementation doesn't limit users
to key chords which consist of only two keys. Key chords in Firebinder
can consist of any number of keys. This helps solve a common problem
with the original key-chord, which is that it is difficult to come up
with key chords that don't conflict with normal typing.

*** Extensible
GNU Emacs provides users with an easy way to add new features or
modify the behavior of the program. Users can just drop Emacs Lisp
files in the correct place and when the editor starts it will
automatically evaluate this code. Firebinder provides users with a
similar principle. It allows users to set a directory in which all
code will be evaluated when the extension starts. This allows for easy
and powerful customization without the need for endless GUI options
windows.
***** Ido mode
Ido mode (based on ido-mode written by Kim F. Storm for GNU Emacs)
shows this extensibility. It is available as a single JavaScript file
that users can drop in their configuration directories. It modifies the
native Firebinder minibuffer to behave like it does in GNU Emacs with
ido-mode enabled. Currently supported features include:
- Substring matching (instead of the default prefix matching)
- Default selections that can be immediately chosen with <return>
- Selecting next and previous matches with C-s and C-r respectively
- Restricting to current matches with C-SPC

***** HoK
Another excellent extension for Firefox is KeySnail written by
Masafumi Oyamada. KeySnail has a hinting extension called HoK. HoK has
been ported to Firebinder and is available [[https://github.com/jorenvo/firebinder-extensions/tree/master/hok][in the extension
repository]]. Just like Ido mode it is a single JavaScript that can be
simply installed by dropping it in the configuration directory and
restarting the browser.

** How to use
*** Installation
Installation is done by downloading the firebinder.xpi file
(TODO). After that it can be installed by dragging the xpi file into a
Firefox window or selecting it from the Add-on Manager after clicking
Install add-on from file.
*** First use
It is necessary to set a configuration directory through the provided
preferences menu of the extension. This menu is available in the
Add-on Manager.
*** Bindings
It is important to note that by default Firebinder does not provide
any keybindings. They need to be set by the user. This can be easily
done by a JavaScript file in the configuration directory. I recommend
taking a look at [[https://github.com/jorenvo/firebinder-extensions/tree/master/bindings][the bindings.js file in the extensions repository]]. It
provides some sensible bindings and you might want to use that file as
a starting point. Keep in mind that just like in GNU Emacs, binding
two different functions to the same key combination is not a good
idea.
*** Extensions
Ido mode and HoK are not a part of Firebinder. They are extensions
that are available at [[https://github.com/jorenvo/firebinder-extensions][the extensions repository]]. Installing these
extensions is simple, just put the JavaScript files in the
configuration directory and restart the browser. Extensions may
provide their own default keybindings (eg. firebinder_hok.js), others
may require that you bind the keys yourself. The documentation of the
extension should clarify this.
** Compatibily
Currently the extension has only been tested on an up-to-date Arch
Linux system with Firefox 34.0.5.
